To help in this process, you may want to consider the following suggestions to assist you while you seek the right attorney for your potential legal issue.  Anthony R.

          <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-12">
              <p class="lead">The best way to determine whether you have a legal problem or need legal assistance is to speak with an experienced lawyer.  You should be aware that in larger cities, many lawyers’ practices may be limited to certain areas of the law.  A good place to start that search is by reviewing the attorney’s website and if it appears that attorney is able to help you with your issue, give him/her a call to set up a consultation.  Anthony R. Morrow focuses his practice in federal and state criminal defense, traffic tickets, DWI tickets, and all family law affairs.  Anthony prides himself on being a true litigator.  If you are considering a breach of contract action, small claims recovery (up to $10,000 in certain damages) or seeking to evict a person from property you own, then you have found the right attorney.  Anthony spends a significant amount of his practice in court truly litigating cases before a judge or jury.  Although you can easily find an attorney to handle your case, you deserve to have an attorney that is not afraid to take a case to trial!</p>

          <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-12">
              <p class="lead">The lawyer and client should agree on what expectations that each have, such as settlement, mediation or trial, and how the lawyer will try to obtain those expectations. The client has a right to expect a status report of the case.  The attorney will expect that you are open and honest with him/her about the case and that fees are paid in a timely manner.  With many years of experience, Anthony R. Morrow is a lawyer that you can trust.</p>
